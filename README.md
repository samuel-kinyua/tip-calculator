## My process
I created the markup for this app using the HTML and css to style the page by adding the colors, fonts and created the layout using Flexbox. additionally, I used the media querry to make the page responsive for smaller screens such us mobile phones. finally I used JavaScript and DOM manupulaion to add functionally to the app which enables the calculation and display of the results.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- media querry

### What I learned

While creating this project I learnt quit a number of things. first, I learnt how to use media queries to simplify the responsive ness of the app on different sized screens. secondly, I learnt how to perform DOM  manuplation. third, I learnt how to create better layouts using flexbox

### Continued development

for the future projects I would like to continualy improve on creation of laouts using flexbox and to create flexibility using javaScript and DOM manuplation.

### Useful resources

some of the resources that I found helpful while tackling this project include:
1) what the flexbox - by wes bos (https://flexbox.io/)
2) JavaScript HTML DOM - by w3school (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)
